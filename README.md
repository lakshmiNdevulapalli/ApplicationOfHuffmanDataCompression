# ApplicationOfHuffmanDataCompression
 A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which takes an arbitrary length of text message as input and converts that text into a fixed length of encrypted characters which is infeasible to invert. The values returned by hash function are called as Message digest. Because of its versatility, hash functions are used in many applications such as digital signatures passwords etc., The purpose of this study is to apply Huffman data compression algorithm to the hash function in cryptography. Huffman data compression algorithm is an optimal compression or prefix algorithm where the frequencies of the letters are used to compress the data. An integrated approach is applied to achieve the compression function by integrating Huffman data compression algorithm in the hash function which is a core functionality of hashing computation.
